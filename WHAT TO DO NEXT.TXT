Add email account verification according to STACK OVERFLOW

What you're looking for is called "account verification" or "email verification". There are plenty of Node modules that can perform this, but the principle goes like this:

1. Your User model should have an active attribute that is false by default
2. When the user submits a valid signup form, create a new User (who's active will be false initially)
3. Create a random hash and store it in your database with a reference to the User ID
4. Send an email to the supplied email address with the hash as part of a link pointing back to a route on your server
5. When a user clicks the link and hits your route, check for the hash passed in the URL
6. If the hash exists in the database, get the related user and set their active property to true
7. Delete the hash from the database, it is no longer needed
